# 🔷 TS Learning: TypeScript Learning Platform

[**Read this in Spanish / Leer en Español 🇪🇸**](./README.es.md)

Welcome to your learning environment! This project is designed for you to learn TypeScript in a practical and structured way.

## 📂 Project Structure

To keep things organized, we have divided the code into three key areas:

### 1. 🏗️ The Workshop (Where you work)
**Location:** `app/projects/[project-name]/page.tsx`

This is where the magic happens. Each folder inside `app/projects/` represents a practical challenge.
- Open the `page.tsx` file for each project.
- Look for `TODO` comments or follow the objectives in the UI.
- Implement the requested TypeScript logic.
- See your changes in real-time in the application.
- **New Feature:** You can now toggle the **"Solution / Expected"** section in the UI if you get stuck (available for some projects).

### 2. 📚 The Academy (Theory)
**Location:** `app/concepts/`

Contains interactive theoretical lessons. You can read them in the app or check the code to see how explanations and code comparisons are structured.

### 3. ⚙️ The Machinery (Infrastructure)
**Location:** `src/`

This is the "heart" of the platform. You won't usually need to touch this, but it's useful to see how a real app is built:
- `src/components/`: UI components (Navbar, Buttons, etc.).
- `src/i18n/`: Translation system (Spanish/English).
- `src/hooks/`: Progress tracking logic.
- `src/context/`: Global application state.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Open the app**:
    Go to `http://localhost:3000`.

4.  **Follow the path**:
    - Start with **Theory** on the home screen.
    - When ready, go to the **Projects** section.
    - Open the corresponding file in your editor and start coding!
